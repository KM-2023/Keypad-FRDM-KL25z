# Keypad-FRDM-KL25z
In this project, we will be writing an Embedded C program to configure a 4x4 matrix keypad to display an output on tera term, an emulator program installed on our computer. Our program would instruct our FRDM-KL25z board to constantly scan the keypad for new presses and display them, based on our code, on our computer.
